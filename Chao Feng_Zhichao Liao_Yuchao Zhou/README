Milestone:
In shortly, we implemented the insert, Sanity Check, Print, Update functions. 
We did not implment the delete function and fast range queries.

For the Sanity Check:
1. We check whether the tree is integrated or not. In another words, check if the tree missing any keys or values.
2. We check the keys in every btree node are in order.
3. We check the key count in the superblock is the same as the actual nummber of keys in the tree's leaf nodes.
